# Contributing

In order to contribute, the code you submit must include the entire function provided by mabl in the code editor; along with the code you create that interacts with your application. In terms of generality, you can replace a specific link or reference with a more general link/reference that still correctly demonstrates the original intent of the custom JavaScript snippet.

## Getting Started

See [here](https://github.com/EdgarJoelM/mabl-JavaScript-snippets/blob/master/user%20snippets/user%20example.js) for an example of what should be submitted for a pull request.

If you would like more information on how to do so, see [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
